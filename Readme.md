# Slug compiler

## Overview

A slug is a compressed archive of an app's code, to be stored in S3
and subsequently fetched by runtime instances (the
[dyno grid](http://heroku.com/how/dyno_grid)) for execution of one of
the app's processes.

The slug compiler is a program which uses a buildpack to transform
application source into a slug.

Inputs: source, cache, buildpack URL, feature flags?

Output: slug, process_types, config vars?

Note that this is a trimmed down version of the slug compiler that
currently runs in production on Heroku. It's intended for next-gen
services but is not currently in production use.

## Usage

In the typical git-based Heroku deploy, the slug compiler is invoked
via a Git pre-recieve hook. However, this code has been extracted so
that the same process can be used elsewhere.

Note that it will delete .slugignore patterns and other files, so you
shouldn't run this straight out of a checkout. Create a fresh copy of
the application source before compiling it.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9
* tar
* du
* git (optional, used for fetching non-HTTP buildpacks)

## Responsibilities

The new slug compiler does much less than the old one. In particular,
these operations are now the responsibility of the caller:

* checking size of the slug
* stack migration
* detecting among set of default buildpacks
* git submodule handling
* special-cased bamboo operations
* calling releases API
* storing slug file in S3
* deploy hooks
